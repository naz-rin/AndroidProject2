Hello, to whoever is viewing this video. This is MeteorPop, a game made with Cody Schieferstine. The game starts with the branding screen, which is “appropriated” from the game Earth Defense Force. Then we are taken to the main menu, with three buttons named, in order,. “Play Game,” “Story,” and “About.” Tapping on About will lead us to a screen with two buttons labeled “About” and “Back to Menu.” Clicking on the About button will show a notifier stating the game’s creators, Ramon Bersamin and Cody Schieferstine. Now we go back to the Main Menu and view the story. Now that we have viewed every button on the Main Menu except the Play Game button, let’s play the game! After the screen is loaded, the player is faced with four meteors falling at different speeds. The goal is not to let the meteors touch the ground or else the player is shown the game over page with a button that goes back to the Main Menu.
